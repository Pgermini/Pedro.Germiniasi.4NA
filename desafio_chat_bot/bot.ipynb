Young Satoshi has not only dreamed of becoming a Pok√©mon trainer but also a \"Pok√©mon Master,\" and on the arrival of his 10th birthday, he finally has a chance to make that dream a reality. Unfortunately for him, all three Pok√©mon available to beginning trainers have already been claimed and only Pikachu, a rebellious Electric-type Pok√©mon, remains. However, this chance encounter would mark the start of a lifelong friendship and an epic adventure!\\n\\nSetting off on a journey to become the very best, Satoshi and Pikachu travel across beautiful, sprawling regions with their friends Kasumi, a Water-type trainer, and Takeshi, a Rock-type trainer. But danger lurks around every corner. The infamous Team Rocket is always nearby, seeking to steal powerful Pok√©mon through nefarious schemes. It\\'ll be up to Satoshi and his friends to thwart their efforts as he also strives to earn the eight Pok√©mon Gym Badges he\\'ll need to challenge the Pok√©mon League, and eventually claim the title of Pok√©mon Master. \\n\\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]'}"
